HTMLContext Demo
----------------

This demo uses the HTMLContext to draw multiple shapes on screen.  On browsers which support it, CSS transformations are used to rotate the shapes.  The demonstration includes:

* The HTMLContext rendering context

* CSS Transformations on supported systems
* Loading and playing sounds
* The DOM rendering context
