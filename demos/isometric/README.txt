Isometric Demo
---------------

The isometric demonstration is a proof of concept that isometric tile mapping and manipulation can be done with the engine using the HTML rendering context as the primary context.  The demonstration currently includes:

* Loading and drawing an isometric world
* Using the DOM context to render the world
* Mouse input to control the world

As the demo matures, the final demo will contain:

* Loading additional resources on the fly via AJAX streaming
* Simple Multiplayer positioning and socket communication
* Persistent world state
* A*star path finding
* Simple state machine AI
